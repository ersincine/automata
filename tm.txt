# === WHAT? ===
# Specify a Turing machine by writing each transition as a single line.

# === HOW? ===
# Use this notation for each transition: 
# source_state : symbols_to_read > symbol_to_write, direction: destination_state
# where symbols_to_read is one or more alternative symbols separated by a comma, and direction is either "l" (left) or "r" (right).
# For example: q0 : a, b, c > d, l : q1
# You can omit symbol_to_write if the existing symbol will not be replaced.
# For example: q0 : a, b > r : q1
# Source state of the first transition must be the start state!
# The accept state must be named "accept".
# Use "." for the blank symbol.
# You must omit the transitions to the reject state.

# === RESTRICTIONS ===
# Symbols must be single characters: . (the blank symbol), a, b, 0, 1, $, ...
# Symbols cannot be any of these special characters:  ":"  ","  ">" 
# State names can be any alphanumeric string: accept (the accept state), q1, 1, Q10, ...

# === NOTE ===
# Space characters in transition will be discarded.
# Empty lines and comment lines (i.e., lines which start with "#") will be discarded.

# === BELOW IS THE TM ===
q1 : # > r : q8
q8 : x > r : q8
q8 : . > r : accept

q1 : 1 > x, r : q3
q3 : 0, 1 > r : q3
q3 : # > r : q5
q5 : x > r : q5
q5 : 1 > x, l : q6

q1 : 0 > x, r : q2
q2 : 0, 1 > r : q2
q2 : # > r : q4
q4 : x > r : q4
q4 : 0 > x, l : q6

q6 : x > l : q6
q6 : # > l : q7
q7 : 0, 1 > l : q7
q7 : x > r : q1
