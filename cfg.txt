# === WHAT? ===
# Specify a grammar by writing its rules in one or more lines.

# === HOW? ===
# Left-hand side of the first rule must be the start variable!
# Use > as an arrow. For example: X > y
# Use "e" for epsilon. For example: X > e
# You can use "|" for indicating alternatives. For example: X > y | e

# === RESTRICTIONS ===
# Variables and terminals must consist of a single character.
# Use capital English letters for variables: A, B, C, D, E, ..., Z
# Use digits and lowercase English letters except 'e' for terminals: 0, 1, ..., 9, a, b, c, d, f, ..., z

# === NOTE ===
# Space characters in rules will be discarded.
# Empty lines and comment lines (i.e., lines which start with "#") will be discarded.

# === BELOW IS THE GRAMMAR ===
S > 0S1 | SS | e

# Alternative grammar for the same language: S > 0S1 | e | 01S
# Alternative grammar for the same language: S > 0S1S | e
# Alternative grammar for the same language: S > S0S1 | e
