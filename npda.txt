# === WHAT? ===
# Specify an NPDA by writing each transition as a single line, and listing all the accept states in the last line.

# === HOW? ===
# Use this notation for each transition: source_state : input_symbol_or_e_to_consume, stack_symbol_or_e_to_pop > stack_symbol_or_e_to_push : destination_state
# For example: q0 : e, e > $ : q1
# Use "e" for epsilon and nothing else.
# Source state of the first transition must be the start state!
# Last line must include all accept states separated by a comma.

# === RESTRICTIONS ===
# Symbols must be single characters: a, b, 0, 1, $, ...
# Symbols cannot be any of these special characters:  ":"  ","  ">"
# State names can be any alphanumeric string: a, q1, 1, Q10, ...

# === NOTE ===
# Space characters in transition will be discarded.
# Empty lines and comment lines (i.e., lines which start with "#") will be discarded.

# === BELOW IS THE NPDA ===
# Transitions (one line for each transition):
q0 : e, e > $ : q1
q1 : 0, e > x : q1
q1 : 1, x > e : q1
q1 : e, $ > e : q2

# Accept states as comma separated values:
q2
